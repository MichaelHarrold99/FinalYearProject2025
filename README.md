#This is code used to reconcile hypermutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates to their phylogenetic tree branch lengths. With a comparison between hypermutators and non-hypermutators.
We started by running QUAST on all the assemblies to get basic quality metrics and ensure everything was in order. For the hypermutator gene analysis, we first compiled the known mutations in the mutS, mutL, mutY, and uvrD genes. Then, we used TBLASTN to align each assembly’s mutS gene against the wild-type PAO1 mutS amino acid sequence. The output from TBLASTN was processed with awk to generate multi-FASTA files, which we later aligned with MUSCLE. We used Jalview to visualize these alignments, allowing us to pinpoint assemblies that carried the specific amino acid substitutions linked to hypermutation, particularly in mutS.

Next, we divided the assemblies into nine batches and used Parsnp with P. aeruginosa PAO1 as the reference—to perform core-genome alignments and identify SNPs. The resulting VCF files for each batch were merged with bcftools and then converted to a multi-FASTA format using vcf2phylip. We further refined the data by running snp-sites with the -c flag to extract only the variable SNP columns and remove ambiguous nucleotides.

For constructing the phylogenetic tree, FastTree was used with the Generalized Time-Reversible (GTR) model and gamma rate variation. The resulting tree was visualized with iTOL, and additional processing was done in R. There, we used packages like ape, dplyr, and phangorn to root the tree at its midpoint, and ggplot2 helped us create clear plots.

Finally, we compared the root-to-tip distances between hypermutator and non-hypermutator assemblies. We ran a Welch Two Sample t-test (with significance set at p < 0.05) and a Wilcoxon rank sum test to back up our findings. To dive deeper, we performed a one-way ANOVA to assess differences among three groups: hypermutators with the A187S substitution, hypermutators with the T493P substitution, and non-hypermutators followed by Tukey’s HSD for post hoc analysis.
